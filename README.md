# Uber Demand and Supply 

## Overview

You may have some experience of traveling to and from the airport.
These are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue.

As an analyst, I would like to address this problem Uber is facing - driver cancellation and non-availability of cars leading to loss of potential revenue.
The aim of the analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of this analysis, we should be able to present the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.

## Features

Uber provides ride hailing services by providing a application platform that connects drivers with cars to people who needs get from point A to point B. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue.

To  increase its chances to connect both the drivers (the supply part of the service) and the riders (the demand part of the service), Uber needs to work out the gaps where the supply is not meeting the demand and how to fulfill that gap. 

These campaigns are intended for the bank’s existing customers. However, the marketing campaigns need to be cost-efficient so that the bank not only increases their overall revenues but also the total profit. You need to apply your knowledge of EDA on the given dataset to analyse the patterns and provide inferences/solutions for the future marketing campaign.
The bank conducted a telemarketing campaign for one of its financial products ‘Term Deposits’ to help foster long-term relationships with existing customers. The dataset contains information about all the customers who were contacted during a particular year to open term deposit accounts.

There are six attributes associated with each request made by a customer:

Request id: A unique identifier of the request
Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request
Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed 
Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
Status of the request: The final status of the trip, can be either completed, canceled by the driver or no cars are available
Note: For this Analysis, only the trips to and from the airport are being considered.
